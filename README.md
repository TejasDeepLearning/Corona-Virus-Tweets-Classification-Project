# Corona-Virus-Tweets-Classification-Project
This repository contains the files used in my natural language processing project where I classified tweets about the ongoing pandemic. The entire process is located in the Corona_nlp.ipynb file and we use it to build an application in streamlit.

## Project Description
The goal of this project was to segment tweets belonging to different people to understand the various opinions on the recent Pandemic and how that is affecting everyones lives. The model's task would be to train on a whole heap of these tweets, analyse them and classify them based on theri sentiment, whether that be god, bad, or extremely volatile.

## What to install
You'll need to install tensorflow and NLTK and make sure that there are no confilicting libraries in your space. Then set up an environment, be it locally or on the cloud to begin training.

## How to run the project
Once you have your environment set up, You'll have to get a dataset created for preprocessing and training. I downloaded mine from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/covid19-tweets) but you can find any dataset that interests you. I used this [Tensorflow tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/word2vec) as reference to guide me through the project.
